Project-Euler-Javascript
========================

Answers to Project Euler questions in Javascript

I created this repo to practice Javascript. My process is pretty simple:

1. Pseudo-Code the problem
2. Solve things naively, looking up methods native to js for help 
3. Refactor my code.
4. Check my answers against others' to look for cleaner and faster ways of solving the problems.

[I also did many of these in Ruby here](https://www.github.com/allizad/Project_Euler_Answers)
